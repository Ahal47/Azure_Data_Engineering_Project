Azure Data Engineering Project

Architected and developed a scalable ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory to automate data ingestion from multiple sources, including an on-premises SQL Server database and GitHub's REST API, improving data availability for analytics.

Engineered efficient data extraction methods: utilized the ADF Copy Activity for high-performance data migration from SQL Server and configured ADF Web Activity to handle paginated JSON responses from the GitHub API.

Implemented a medallion architecture (Bronze layer) by landing raw data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in its native format , establishing a robust foundation for future data transformation and analysis.

Orchestrated and scheduled pipelines to run automatically, ensuring timely and reliable data flow, which reduced manual data collection efforts
